(*
NB: Instances for mutable types (including

   ref
   queue
   stack
   array
   stream
   buffer)

are deliberately omitted.  Since sharing is detectable for values of
these types we have two distinct design choices:

  1. Always create a new copy that shares no structure with the
     original.

  2. Always mutate the original copy

Neither of these seems like the right thing to do, so instead we
simply don't handle mustable types at all.

(Lazy.t is another example: we'd like map to be total and side-effect
free, which is impossible to guarantee if we handle lazy.
