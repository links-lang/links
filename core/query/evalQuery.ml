(* Introducing ordering indexes in order to support a list
   semantics. *)
module Order =
struct
  type gen = Var.var * Q.t
  type context = gen list

(* TODO:

      - add a setting for selecting unordered queries
      - more refined generation of ordered queries
        - make use of unique keys to
          cut down on the number of order indexes
        - share order indexes when possible
        - remove duplicate fields from the output
  *)

  (* The following abstraction should allow us to customise the
     concrete choice of order indexes.

     In particular, we might use primary keys for generators.

     Including tail generators gives:

     table t

     a deterministic semantics, in the sense that asList (table t)
     will return the same list of rows throughout a query.

     In general this is unlikely to be necessary, as the programmer
     can supply an orderby clause when needed.

     If we ignore tail generators, then this corresponds to
     interpretting asList (table t) non-deterministically, that is,
     each invocation of asList (table t) may return a different
     permutation of the rows. (In practice, it's not clear whether
     real databases actually take advantage of the freedom to
     reorganise rows within a single query, but I believe it is
     allowed.)

     Given the non-deterministic interpration of asList, the
     normalisation procedure becomes technically unsound as it may
     duplicate instances of asList. If we wanted to restore soundness
     then we could do so by keeping track of which tables get
     duplicated and ensuring that we order by all occurences of them -
     e.g. by converting tail generators to non-tail generators. *)

  type order_index = [ `Val of Q.t | `Gen of gen | `TailGen of gen
                     | `DefVal of Types.primitive | `DefGen of gen | `DefTailGen of gen
                     | `Branch of int ]

  (* TODO:

     We should probably represent 'defaultness' using a boolean flag
     rather than wiring it into a single polymorphic variant type. *)

  (* We might implement an optimisation to remove duplicate
     expressions from the output - in particular, the expressions we
     order by will often already be present in the output. Perhaps,
     though, it would make sense to apply such an optimisation more
     generally on any query. For instance:

     for (x <-- t) [(x.a, x.a)]

     might be translated as:

     select x.a from t as a

     followed by a post-processing phase that creates two copies of
     x.a.

     Another optimisation would be to remove duplicate expressions
     from the output order by clause. More ambitiously, this could be
     further generalised to handle examples such as the following:

     for (x <-- t) orderby (x.a, -x.a) [x]

     which is equivalent to:

     for (x <-- t) orderby (x.a) [x] *)
