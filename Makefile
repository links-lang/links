# Makefile for the Links Programming Language.
#

# This file contains instructions for building a bleeding-edge version
# of Links in release or development mode with and without database
# support.

# LATEST STABLE RELEASE
# =====================
# To install the latest stable release of Links please see the INSTALL
# file.

# To build the bleeding-edge version of Links please refer to the
# instructions below.

# DEVELOPMENT
# ===========
# By default the build rule `all' attempts to build the latest
# development version of Links with database support, thus the
# following command suffices to build everything
# $ make all
# For legacy reasons the rule `nc' (native compile) is an alias of
# `all'.
# NOTE: The rule `all' may skip the building the database drivers if
# the necessary system prerequisites are absent.

# The following command builds Links in development mode without
# database support
# $ make no-db

# RELEASE
# =======
# To build Links in release mode use the following command
# $ make all-release
# This rule builds every artefact which is part of a release. As such,
# it will include all the database drivers. Currently, there is no
# support for building Links without database support in release mode.
