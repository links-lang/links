(*
  This function is intended to be used to dump the types and
  positions of all variables in a program. It should be useful for
  enabling Tom's IDE to display typing tooltips for variables.

  Technically the dumper is incorrect because the current environment
  does not necessarily respect lexical scope. However, it should work
  anyway as the type checker ensures the program is well-typed and in
  particular that there are no free variables.
