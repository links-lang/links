Introduction
============

In this section, we informally describe the Links language itself.

Links is a `functional programming language`_, meaning that functions are
first-class values, meaning they can be bound to variables as just like an
integer or a string. Additionally, as a functional programming language,
variables are `immutable`, meaning that they cannot be assigned to more than
once.
